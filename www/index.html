								<h2>1. Minimise the number of slides</h2>
								<p>Can you get your message across with as few slides as possible?</p>
								<p>For some presentations, the ideal number of slides might be none at all.</p>

						<h2>2. Use original images</h2>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-inner">
								<h2>2. Avoid over-used images</h2>
								<p>Certain images are over-used in presenations, which can lead to your audience quickly losing interest.</p>
								<p>Pictures of Gears, Arhcery targets, Handshakes and People holding hands around a globe are all too common.</p>
							</div>

						<h2>3. Use the best images available </h2>

								<h2>3. Use the best images available </h2>
								<p>It is estimated that 85% of the photos used in presentations are taken from Google Images.</p>
								<p>But did you know that Getty Images has made large numbers of professional photographs available for free?</p>
								<p>If your presentation relies on imagery, there is no excuse for not finding great pictures.</p>

								<h2>4. Consistent look and feel</h2>
								<p>An inconsistent look and feel can distract users from the message of your presentation.</p>

							<div class="overlay-inner">
								<h2>5. Be concise</h2>							
								<p>Try to communicate points using as little text as possible.</p>
								<p>This will also allow you to use a suitably large font to ensure that your slides are readable.</p>

					<div class="grid-cell">
						<h2>6. Focus on the message</h2>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-inner">
								<h2>6. Focus on the message</h2>
								<p>Consider the message that you want you audience to retain, focus your effort on conveying it.</p>
								<p>Use images for illustration only. Any design elements that distract from the message should not be used.</p>

						<h2>7. Tell a story</h2>

							<div class="overlay-inner">
								<h2>7. Tell a story</h2>
								
								<p>If you can use stories in your presentation, your audience is more likely to engage and to remember your points afterwards.</p> 
								<p>Including stories in your presentation is helpful, but ideally your whole presentation should act like a story.</p>

						<h2>8. Involve the audience</h2>

							<div class="overlay-inner">
								<h2>8. Involve the audience</h2>
								
								<p>The audience is more likely to engage with your presentation as active participants rather than listeners.</p>
								<p>Presentation is not theatre; don't be afraid to break the fourth wall.</p>
								<p>There are many ways to invlove the audience, from a simple show of hands, to role playing and group exercises.</p>

						<h2>9. Don't over-use your slideshow</h2>
						<div class="overlay">
							<div class="overlay-inner">
								<h2>9. Don't over-use your slideshow</h2>
								
								<p>Remember that your slideshow should support your presentation, not be the presentation itself.</p>
								<p>There are many other factors to consider, such as vocal delivery, body language and use of activities.</p>
								<p>TED's most viewed talk of all time hasn't a single slide, and many of TED's most successful talks have a focus on what's said, not seen</p>
